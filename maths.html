        <h1>Bhaskara - The Mathematician</h1>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Bhaskara II, also known as Bhaskara the Younger, was an Indian mathematician and astronomer. 
                He was born in 1114 CE in India, and his contributions to mathematics and astronomy had a lasting 
                impact on the world. His most famous work is the <strong>“Siddhanta Shiromani”</strong>, in which he 
                provided solutions to algebraic equations, explored trigonometric functions, and developed important 
                methods that were later adopted in Europe.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Contributions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Algebra:</strong> Bhaskara made significant advances in solving quadratic and cubic equations. He is often credited with discovering the concept of "zero" and solving equations that would later influence European mathematicians.</li>
                <li><strong>Arithmetic:</strong> He worked extensively on number systems, including methods for dealing with large numbers, and improvements to the Indian numeral system.</li>
                <li><strong>Trigonometry:</strong> Bhaskara developed sine and cosine rules, and his work in trigonometry was well ahead of his time. He also introduced the concept of the sine function, an important tool in modern trigonometry.</li>
                <li><strong>Calculus:</strong> Although calculus was formally developed in the West centuries later, Bhaskara had an early understanding of calculus concepts such as differentiation and integration.</li>
                <li><strong>Astronomy:</strong> Bhaskara made numerous contributions to astronomy, including accurate calculations of planetary motions and eclipses, and methods for predicting their occurrences.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>
                Bhaskara's mathematical and astronomical contributions continue to influence modern-day studies. His work was rediscovered in Europe during the 12th century, and his techniques were used by notable European mathematicians like Fibonacci and others. Today, Bhaskara is celebrated as one of the greatest mathematicians and astronomers from ancient India.
