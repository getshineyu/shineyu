        <h2>Geographical Routes to India</h2>
        <p>India's strategic location and geographical features made it a key destination for travelers from various regions of the world. Let's explore some of the major routes and geographical advantages that made India accessible:</p>

        <div class="routes">
            <h3>1. Overland Routes</h3>
            <p>The famous Silk Road connected China to India through Central Asia, traversing deserts and mountains.

            <h3>2. Sea Routes</h3>
            <p>India's coastal geography facilitated maritime trade. The Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, and Indian Ocean were key routes for seafaring merchants from Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Southeast Asia, and even distant lands like Egypt and Greece. Indian ports such as those in Gujarat, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu were bustling centers of trade and cultural exchange.</p>

            <h3>3. Natural Features for Trade and Travel</h3>
            <p>India's favorable monsoon climate and river systems, such as the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra, were crucial for trade and travel. These rivers acted as highways for transporting goods and travelers across the subcontinent. The fertile plains and rich agricultural regions also supported the growth of trade cities.</p>
